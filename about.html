      <h2>Why Hawaiian Birds?</h2>
      <p>
        Hawaii was once home to the largest diversity of birds. Unforunately, most species were lost after the arrival of humans. 
        However, there are still a lot of Hawaiian birds found nowhere else on Earth. Many are still threatened due to introduced predators and diseases, habitat loss, and climate change.
        This website aims to raise awareness by showcasing these spectacular birds in their natural habitats.
