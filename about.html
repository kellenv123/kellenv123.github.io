      <h2>📸 Photographer's Note</h2>
      <p>
        Aloha! I'm [Your Name], a wildlife photographer and conservation enthusiast based in Hilo, Hawaii.
        This project began as a personal journey to explore the diverse avian life found across the Hawaiian Islands.
        Over time, it evolved into a mission: to educate, inspire, and promote the preservation of Hawaii's unique bird species through visual storytelling.
      </p>

      <h2>🌺 Why Hawaiian Birds?</h2>
      <p>
        Hawaii is home to some of the most rare and endangered birds in the world.
        Many species are found nowhere else on Earth, and some are critically threatened due to habitat loss, invasive species, and climate change.
        This website aims to raise awareness by showcasing these birds in their natural habitats.
