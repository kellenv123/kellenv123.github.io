      <h2>Learn about their unique behaviors and habitats</h2>
        <p>
            The majority of native Hawaiian birds inhabit upper elevetion ohia-koa forests. They have evolved unique relationships with native plants in these environments that make them reliant on eachother. They are restricted in range both by avaian malaria in lower elevations as well as habitat degradation.
