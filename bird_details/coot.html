    The ʻAlae keʻokeʻo, also known as the Hawaiian coot is a bird in the rail family that is endemic to Hawaiʻi. It is very similar to the American coot, having a black body with a white frontal shield. This bird is found in wetlands on all the main Hawaiian islands, being most common on the island of Hawaiʻi. The Hawaiian coot is federally listed as endanged, with fewer than 2,000 individuals in the wild.
