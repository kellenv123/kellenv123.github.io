    The ʻAkiapolaʻau is a Hawaiian honeycreeper that is only found on the island of Hawaiʻi. It is a stocky yellow bird, sometimes with greenish coloring, with itʻs most notable feature being its unusally curved beak. It is the only bird on the island to exhibit a woodpecker-like foraging strategy.
